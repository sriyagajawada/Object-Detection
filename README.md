The **Object Detection** project leverages the cutting-edge YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model to deliver fast and accurate real-time object identification in both images and video streams. Designed for versatility, it excels in applications ranging from security surveillance and industrial automation to retail analytics and smart city solutions. A key advantage is its offline functionality, ensuring data privacy and reliability in environments with limited connectivity. The system supports custom model training, allowing adaptation to specific object recognition needs. Built on a robust tech stack including Python, OpenCV, and PyTorch, the solution is optimized for performance across both cloud and edge devices, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios. Its lightweight architecture doesn't compromise on precision, maintaining YOLOv8's renowned balance between speed and detection accuracy
